# Instances_Stochastic_ALBP1
Instances for assembly line balancing problem with stochastic operation time to minimize the station number  
This project contains the instances utilized in [1]. The operation times are generated by [1] and the precedence relations are taken from [2] and [3]. To gain a more in-depth and thorough understanding of this problem, interested authors are encouraged to refer to our relevant papers [1].
